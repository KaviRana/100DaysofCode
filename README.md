# 100 Days of Machine Learning

## Introduction

The 100 Days of Code is a well-known coding challenge that anyone, regardless of their background, can undertake to significantly enhance their coding skills. Rules are straightforward: maintain a continuous streak of 100 days where you learn a new skill and put it into practice. On top of that, I have made the decision that by the end of the 100 Days of Machine Learning challenge, I will create ONE project based on solving a real world problem.
